# Error_Correcting_Codes
This repository holds different files related to Error Correcting Codes such as computations on codes and calculating bounds. The file 'compute_tables_on_bounds' produces some tables for bounds on the sizes of codes pertaining to the dimension of the codes and their minimum distance. The file 'compute_linear_codes' contains some basic functions for polynomial arithmitic, arithmatic in finite fields for both scalars and matrices, calculations on specific codes, and computing bounds on the sizes on codes. Lastly, the file 'examples_compute_linear_codes' has some examples using the functions in 'compute_linear_codes'.

The bounds and material about linear codes stem mainly from:
- William Cary Huffman and Vera Pless (2003). Fundamentals of Error-Correcting Codes. Cambridge. ISBN 9780521131704.

The modulo arithmitic and polynomial division stem from the above source and:
- Niels Lauritzen (2003). Concrete Abstract Algebra: From Numbers to Gr√∂bner Bases. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 9780521534109.
